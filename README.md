# Timeline Animation

 Programing test for a company to explain a concept in the form of a timeline animation. I decided to add a twist to the old add fruit together as a kid lesson. This was suppose to be just a short animation to demonstrate timeline functionality. 


*** There will be a unity package, "addition101", that can be used to drag and drop the unity scene into any unity project(version 2020 and higher) to play with and test. There will also be an .exe build int he build folder.
