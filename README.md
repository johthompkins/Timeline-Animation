# Timeline Animation

I decided to add a twist to the old add fruit together as a kid lesson. This was suppose to be just a short animation to demonstrate timeline functionality. 


*** There will be a unity package, "addition101", that can be used to drag and drop the unity scene into any unity project(version 2021 and higher) to play with and test.
***There will also be an .exe build in Timeline Animation/build/version1.0.0 folder.
